     Swaps coefficients in the z-vector around an amount determined by the power of the z multiplied onto the equation, specifically abs(p) / 2. In the recursion, a multiplication with z is always with a z of a higher (absolute) power than whatever equation it is multiplied onto. For example, the following could occur in the recursion:
            z^3 * (A_1(z^(-1), r)) = z^3 * (1 - rz^(-1)) = z^3 - rz^2
     So whatever z^3 was multiplied onto (in this case z^0 - rz^(-1)) had lower (absolute) powers than z^3 itself AND of opposite sign. The coefficient-vector of the equation {1, -r, 0, 0} can now be flipped around index abs(3) / 2 = 1.5, so between -r and 0. If this is done, the coefficient-vector of the solution looks like {0, 0, -r, 1}, which is shown in the equation above (i.e., 0z^0 + 0z^1 - rz^2 + 1z^3).
